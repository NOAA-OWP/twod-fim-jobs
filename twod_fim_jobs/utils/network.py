"""Network-modification algorithms for the modify_network job.

Pure transforms over GeoDataFrames plus plain numpy topology arrays — no
manifest or storage concerns (those live in jobs/modify_network.py). Every
function is deterministic: iteration orders are sorted, split ids derive from
the reach they came from, and finalize_network() sorts the output canonically,
so identical inputs produce byte-identical artifacts.

Reach ids are TEXT, not integers. A pass-through split names its new piece
after its parent (``8`` -> ``8`` and ``8_1``), which keeps the lineage legible
and makes collision with a source id impossible by construction — including
with reaches the stream-order filter removed, which a numeric high-water mark
would have to be told about.

Assumptions, stated once:
- Flowpath geometries are digitized upstream -> downstream (first vertex is
  the upstream end), matching NHF convention.
- The network CRS is projected with meter units; lengths and the negative
  lake buffer depend on it (checked at load).

Counter discipline (see modify_network_specs.md Metrics/Accounting): every
removal is counted in exactly one branch, so the reconciliation identity
holds by construction. Trims, strands, and splits keep their rows.

    """Chain-merge short reaches walking upstream from each chain start.

    Spec step 7: starting downstream, absorb the upstream neighbor while (a)
    the chain is still SHORTER than min_length_threshold_km, (b) the
    neighbor's drainage-area difference from the CHAIN START is under the
    threshold, and (c) the current reach has exactly one upstream neighbor
    (junctions never merge).

    The length threshold is a floor, not a ceiling. Short reaches are the
    problem being solved, so merging continues until the chain is long enough
    to be worth modeling and then stops. Consequences: no output reach is
    shorter than the threshold unless topology or drainage area prevented it,
    and a merged chain cannot exceed the threshold by more than the length of
    the single reach that crossed it.

    Drainage area means total_da_sqkm, the cumulative accumulation — not
    area_sqkm, which is the local catchment. The rule asks whether two reaches
    carry the same flow, which only the cumulative value answers; on local
    area a 5% threshold would test roughly the opposite and silently merge
    almost nothing.

    Runs on post-waterbody topology (live reach_to_id). O(n) over numpy
    arrays; geometry is only touched once per merged chain at the end.
    Chain length comes from geometry, since length_km is written only at
    finalize. Merged rows keep the chain start's attributes — it is the most
    downstream reach of the chain, so its total_da_sqkm, lake_inlet,
    terminal state and lake_to_id all carry through untouched — plus the
    joined geometry (see _join_in_flow_order), the top member's is_headwater /
    lake_outlet (both describe the upstream end), and any member's
    is_trimmed. Tributary pointers into absorbed members are re-pointed at
    the surviving reach_id.

    Note that lake inlets and coastal trims have a null reach_to_id, so they
    can never be a parent and are therefore always chain starts, never
    absorbed members.
