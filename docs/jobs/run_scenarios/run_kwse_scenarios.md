# run_kwse_scenarios

## Overview

Run a hydraulic solver for a set of user-defined scenarios.  A scenario is defined by an upstream discharge, a (previously-run) downstream scenario, and optionally, a depth grid to hot-start the scenario.  Water surface elevations are enforced on a cell-by-cell basis along the stage transfer line of the downstream scenario onto the current reach's domain.  Scenarios are run in serial, such that scenarios earlier in the user-defined list can serve as hot-starts for later scenarios.  Any scenario that already exists on storage is skipped instead of being re-run.

## Processing Scope

 - Retrieve the model manifest for the reach to be modeled.
 - Iterate over all scenarios. For each scenario,
   - Check if a scenario with the same inputs has already been run, skip if it has
   - Create an inflow boundary condition using the provided discharge
   - Apply a steep normal depth outflow condition along domain edges intersecting the downstream model's inundated area (slope = 0.5 m/m)
   - Apply water surface elevations from a downstream scenario on a cell-by-cell basis along the downstream scenario's stage transfer line.
   - If a hot start is specified, locate the depth tif for that scenario and set as the initial model state.
   - Solve the scenario
   - Post-process the results to derive a depth grid, inundated area polygon, stage transfer line, and optional zarr for timestep-specific depth/wse.
   - Publish results to final storage location
 - Assemble list of generated scenario manifests and warnings, then return


## Out of Scope

- Building the Model (`build_model`'s job).
- Deciding which `(q, z)` scenario points to run (`plan_scenarios`, reconciler-owned).
- ND runs (`run_nd_scenarios`) — a KWSE run may consume an ND run's `depth.tif` as a hotstart, but doesn't produce one.
- Composite/library post-processing.
- Determining hotstart and stage transfer.

## Dependencies

- Python
- GDAL
- AWS CLI
- LISFLOOD or SFINCS

## Errors

- No custom errors are currently defined for this job

## Checks

- If a scenario with the same inputs has already been run and exists on storage, that scenario is skipped.
- Solver exit code is 0


## Performance

Typical runtime: ~3 minutes × number of scenarios in the batch.
